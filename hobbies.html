                        Fishing is one of my favorite outdoor activities, enjoyed year-round through both summer and ice fishing. I often fish with family and friends, targeting species such as Smallmouth Bass, Walleye, and Perch. I recently took a trip up north just south of the boundary waters in Lutsen and went out and caught a whole bunch of walleye. In the picture to the left I am holding up the biggest northern I have every caught, measuring 37.5 inches. This northern was really speical for me because I caught it while in a kayak. It was a really rewarding fight because it took so long to try and land it while being in a kayak.

                        Hunting, I go hunting most of the year, I hunt for deer, pheasants and turkey. I do this with my Dad in the spring and in the fall for multiple weekend during those times. In the picture to the left is me with my dog Walter after he retreived a pheasant I harvested in South Daktota. This was one of my first pheasants I had shot so I was really excited.

                        As I stated on previously stated on the home page Sports are one of my most favorite hobbies. In the picture to the left my friends and I are all taking a picture after our 6th consecutive win in our basketball league. This league was mostly just a hobbie league and a fun way for my friends and I to get together and be active.
