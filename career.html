                            I would like to work here because one of their locations is in Minneapolis which is close to my home. I also went to the career fair and talked to their recruiters and they said that they offer a very good support system for their internship. I am not yet qualified for this position. SmithSchafer is looking for internships for the summer of 2027 and at that point I would be qualified for the position. My skills align with this company because they said that they want someone who is willing and wanting to get better everyday and also a hard worker and I feel like I fit into that criteria.

                            I would like this internship because again they have a location in the cities which is close to my home which would make commuting very easy. I also liked this company a lot because they were a bigger more established firm which is what I am looking for. This firm also stated that they have a very good support system for all of their internships and said that a lot of the kids that interned for them got hired afterwards. I am also not qualified for this one until 2027 because I need to take higher level accounting classes before I can get the internship. My skill align very well with this company, they said the want someone who is a quick learner and someone who wants to make the company better everyday and I think I can provide those two things for them.
